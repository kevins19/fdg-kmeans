# K-Means Clustering with Force-Directed Graphs

Force-directed graphs (FDGs) are a class of graph visualization algorithms that utilize physics laws to render graphs aesthetically in a two-dimensional space. Recent research, however, has shown that FDGs are also effective in other applications, such as community detection. We, in particular, target k-means, an unsupervised centroid-based algorithm. Using FDGs as a mode of dimensionality reduction, we use a modified FDG approach to create a more effective clustering algorithm.
